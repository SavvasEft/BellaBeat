# Project description:

HappySmartWatch is a high-tech manufacturer, focused on of health products. Focusing on their smart watch device, they and want to improve on how the smart watch calculates calories burned for different users, and upgrade their current Calorie-burning models. In this project, I build and evaluate new models on calories burned, separately for each user.

# Skills

**Python** was used for data preparation, processing, analysis and modeling.
The project focuses in building and evaluating machine learning models that estimate the calories burned based on heartrate and steps.
The following models where evaluated (for every user):
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression 
  - Polynomial Regression, 2nd degree
  - Polynomial Regression, 2nd degree (Multivariant)
  - Polynomial Regression, 3rd degree (Multivariant)
  - Support Vector Regression,
  - Support Vector Regression, (Multivariant)
  - Random Forest Regression, (Multivariant)

# Data used:

For this project, the data used (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) were made available through Mobius (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic , CC0: Public Domain). The scenario is completely imaginary. It was inspired by an analytics case study, (BellaBeat) for google data analytics professional certificate.
