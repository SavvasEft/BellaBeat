# Project description:

BellaBeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The goal of this project is to re-evaluate how the company calculates calories burned. Based on the steps and the heartrate, our goal is to calculate the best model to estimate the calories burned for each user. The results are to be used to improve the model that the company already uses for calorie burning estimates. 

# Skills

**Python** was used for data preparation, processing, alysis, modeling.
The project focuses in building and evaluating machine learning models that estimate the calories based on heartrate and steps. 
Single linear and multi linear regression models are used and compared.


# Data used:

For this project, the data used (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) were made available through Mobius (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic , CC0: Public Domain). Although BellaBeat is a real company (https://bellabeat.com/) the senario is completely imaginary. It was inspired by an analytics case study, in google data analytics professional certificate.
