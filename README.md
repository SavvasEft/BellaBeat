# Project description:

A high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products wants to upgrade their Calorie-burning model. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate new models on calories burned, separately for each user.

# Skills

**Python** was used for data preparation, processing, analysis and modeling.
The project focuses in building and evaluating machine learning models that estimate the calories based on heartrate and steps.
Building and evaluating the following ML models:
  - Single linear regression models
  - Multi linear regression models
  - Polynomial Regression models
  - Support Vector Regression models


# Data used:

For this project, the data used (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) were made available through Mobius (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic , CC0: Public Domain). The scenario is completely imaginary. It was inspired by an analytics case study, (BellaBeat), in google data analytics professional certificate.
